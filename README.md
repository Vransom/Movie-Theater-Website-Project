# Movie-Theater-Website-Project
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>This is a project that I have worked on during my time at The Tech Academy. It is a website for a sample Movie Theater Client using MVC/MVVM Web Application in C#, along with Bootstrap and Entity Frameworks. It was a great opportunity to work on both the back and front end of a project. I was able to jump into a project that had already been started and pick up/improve upon some things that needed tweaking. Whether it was working on styling pages or adding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, this was a challenging yet rewarding project. I utilized tools like Visual Studio 2019, Azure Devops, and Github, while also communicating with my team through Discord with daily standups and weekly code reviews. I have included some snippets of my work below.</p>
<h2>Front End Development</h2>
Here is my code for the styling of the "About Page" of the theater:
